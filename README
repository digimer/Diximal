NOTE: Until this warning is removed, this program is not finished and should
NOTE: *NOT* be used in any way, shape or form. It will probably do really bad
NOTE: things and then you'd be mad and yell at me. :(


=] What is it?

'diximal' will read in an XML file, parse it and print the resulting data
structure. It's quite rudimentary, and as such, processing instructions and
validation information is simply ignored.


=] Usage

(Planned) usage:

./diximal -f /path/to/file.xml


=] Output Structure

The output from 'diximal' will use the following structure:

- All comments are stripped.

- The XML structure is represented as:
  - TAG::CHILD_TAG_1::CHILD_TAG_2::...::CHILD_TAG_n::attribute=value
  All child tags will be shown as a stand-alone line with no 'attribute=value'
  suffix. Thus, all 'attribute=value' under a given tag structure will be known
  to belong to the preceeding tag(s).

- The output will always begin with 'START' and end with 'END' on their own
  lines. The output should not be trusted unless these are present.

- If any errors are found while parsing the XML, an error will be printed
  followed by an "ERROR" on a new line.


=] Example

Given this XML:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<cluster name="an-cluster" config_version="14">
	
	<!-- Cluster Nodes -->
	<clusternodes>
		<!-- AN!Cluster Node 1 -->
		<!-- 
		The clusternode 'name' value must match the name returned by
		`uname -n`. The network interface with the IP address mapped to
		this name will be the network used by the totem ring. The totem
		ring is used for cluster communication and reconfiguration, so
		all nodes must use network interfaces on the same network for
		the cluster to form. For the same reason, this name must not
		resolve to the localhost IP address (127.0.0.1/::1).
 
		Optional <clusternode ...> arguments:
		- weight="#"; This sets the DLM lock directory weight. This is
		              a DLM kernel option.
		-->
		<clusternode name="an-node01.alteeve.com" nodeid="1">
			<altname name="an-node01-sn" port="6899" 
							mcast="239.94.1.1" />
			<!-- Fence Devices attached to this node. -->
			<fence>
				<method name="node_assassin">
					<device name="batou" port="01"
							 action="reboot"/>
				</method>
			</fence>
		</clusternode>
 
		<!-- AN!Cluster Node 2 -->
		<clusternode name="an-node02.alteeve.com" nodeid="2">
			<altname name="an-node02-sn" port="6899"
							 mcast="239.94.1.1" />
			<fence>
				<method name="node_assassin">
					<device name="batou" port="02"
							 action="reboot"/>
				</method>
			</fence>
		</clusternode>
	</clusternodes>
	<!--
	The fence device is mandatory and it defined how the cluster will
	handle nodes that have dropped out of communication. In our case,
	we will use the Node Assassin fence device.
	-->
	<fencedevices>
		<!--
		This names the device, the agent (script) to controls it,
		where to find it and how to access it.
		-->
		<fencedevice name="batou" agent="fence_na" 
			ipaddr="batou.alteeve.com"  login="section9" 
			passwd="project2501" quiet="1"></fencedevice>
		<fencedevice name="motoko" agent="fence_na" 
			ipaddr="motoko.alteeve.com" login="section9" 
			passwd="project2501" quiet="1"></fencedevice>
		<!--
		If you have two or more fence devices, you can add the extra
		one(s) below. The cluster will attempt to fence a bad node
		using these devices in the order that they appear.
		-->
	</fencedevices>
 
	<!-- When the cluster starts, any nodes not yet in the cluster may be
	fenced. By default, there is a 6 second buffer, but this isn't very
	much time. The following argument increases the time window where other
	nodes can join before being fenced. I like to give up to one minute but
	the Red Hat man page suggests 20 seconds. Please do your own testing to
	determine what time is needed for your environment.
	-->
	<fence_daemon post_join_delay="60">
	</fence_daemon>
</cluster>
